Created by Eric Dufresne, Tyler Nevery.


This is the source code for the iOS app Bomb Voyage which was written in objective-C. 
All images and sounds were made by "Tyler Nevery" and all of the coding and
distribution was done by me. The app has been on the app store
since March 2015 and remains on there. This is the exact code that was submitted for
the current version which is Bomb Voyage 2.2.0.
